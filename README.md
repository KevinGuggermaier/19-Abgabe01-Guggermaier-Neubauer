Project Overview:

	A simple Java Project wich prints out the minimum number, maximum number in an Array List.
	It also calculates the sum of all numbers in an Array List and prints it to the terminal. 
	We have implemented two different classes, the Main and Calculator class. 

Main Class:
 
	Includes the main function. At the beginning we are creating an object from type Calculator. 
	Then we add 5 different values to the Array list. 
	At the end we print the Minimum, Maximum and sum to the console. 

Calculator Class:
	
	Interface 
	
CalculatorImpl Class:

	Overview:
	Includes five different methods and one instance variable. 
		
	Instance Variable: 
	Array List wich includes Integer values

	Method sum() and sum(int i, int sum):
	Calculates the sum of all values which are included in the Array List. 
	Returns the sum.  

	Method getMaximum():
	Returns the highest number which are in the Array List.

	Method getMinimum():
	Returns the lowest number which are in the Array List.

	Method addValue():
	Add a value to the existing Array List.
